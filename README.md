For this project, I collaborated with a client who envisioned a distinct design for their website. Drawing from the versatility of a freely available Bootstrap template, I intricately tailored its features to mirror the client's preferences. 
This strategy enriched my proficiency in manipulating and refining pre-existing code, emulating the challenges one frequently encounters in professional scenarios.

The decision to utilize Bootstrap stemmed from my intent to delve deeper into the capabilities of this renowned CSS framework. My contributions to the website were comprehensive: from the blueprinting of structural layouts and drafting engaging content to seamlessly integrating logos.

Further enhancing the client's digital presence, I facilitated the migration of their original domain from Squareup to a more economical solution via Netlify and Namecheap, optimizing their operational costs.
In addition to the website, I played a pivotal role in setting up their BBB and Google Business profiles, ensuring a consolidated online footprint for the client.
