## Project Description

For this project, I worked closely with a client who had a specific vision for their website. Leveraging the adaptability of a freely available Bootstrap template, I tailored it extensively to align with the client's vision. Crucially, I chose this approach to simulate real-world working scenarios. Often in professional settings, developers encounter established codebases; understanding, adapting, and refining them to suit unique client needs becomes paramount. This project served as a practical exercise in navigating such challenges, honing my ability to manipulate existing code.

Bootstrap was my framework of choice, not just for its ubiquity, but as a means to deepen my understanding of this popular CSS framework. My role in the website development was all-encompassing: from designing the structural layout, penning compelling content, to the seamless integration of logos.

Beyond the website's confines, I streamlined the client's digital transition by migrating their original domain from Squareup to a more cost-effective setup with Netlify and Namecheap. This move not only optimized expenses but also ensured smoother operations. Augmenting their online presence, I was instrumental in establishing their BBB and Google Business profiles, rounding off a robust digital identity for the client.
